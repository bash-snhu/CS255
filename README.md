## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was a system designed to handle the logistics of a company that provides online and practical driving lessons for those looking to take their driving test. The client sought a way to allow their personnel and clients to buy services, book reservations online, take online courses, organize their personnel, and check the status of their appointments through a dashboard.

## What did you do particularly well?

I believe I did a good job understanding the nuances of what the client wished to accomplish, and also extending those intentions to a practical platform that would be scalable and useable by employees without high tech literacy. An online portal delivered by a CMS backend connected to a database that organizes the company's information makes sense to me.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think I could have gone into more depth about the security offerings from different cloud platforms and how those work. Security is a big topic for companies who use their system as their source of income, and the client would likely need to know the nuances of this in greater detail.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs are the most important aspect when developing. One could design the most sophisticated system possible, but if the client doesn't want it or use it, it's functionally useless. Getting to the crux of the user's needs is important for delivering software that is useful to the people purchasing it, and fulfilling all of those needs should be the ultimate goal. Interpreting those needs is a skill and requires knowledge of various tools, along with their strengths and limitations. I read the client's needs as closely as possible, and it was helpful that the interviewer knew the limitations of different platforms in their fact-finding. Then, I considered what kind of system would fulfill the client's needs while not being overcomplicated or difficult to implement.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I have a tendency to approach designing software by thoroughly considering the needs at hand, then jumping in without considering the bigger picture. I often have to revise or refactor certain parts of my code to make necessary changes. In the future, I will start using the diagrams and strategies discussed in this course to set myself up for success when developing. I believe they will help save me time and frustration in the future.
